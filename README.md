# Canonical descriptions

When creating and updating descriptions, use the following guidelines:

* Never use “optionally”. This should be defined by the spec and the SDK dev should take it from there.
* Use a verb with an `s` e.g. Retrieves or Sends.
* Retrieves instead of Gets for describing a GET request.
* Parameters should always have their own row.
* Return value should always be after the listed parameters (on its own row).
* Descriptions always go in the last column.
* Method signature should always be left intact.
* Class descriptions should start "The XXX object…"
* Parameter and return values should be in backticks.
* The expression key-value pairs should be hyphenated as used on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Name%E2%80%93value_pair).
